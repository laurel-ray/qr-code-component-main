### What I learned

This is one of my first projects after a long break from coding. I worked on this to refresh my memory without overwhelming myself with all the things I've forgotten and need to relearn. I learned I've got a long road ahead of me. ðŸ™ƒ

### Continued development

I need to review box model and positioning. I used straight CSS with this project but I'm looking forward to a slightly larger project where I can dust of SCSS in the future.

I need more work on accessibility and responsiveness.
